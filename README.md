## About this Repository

This "documentation" repository has three functions:

- it houses the source code for the [documentation](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/) of the [Islandora project](https://islandora.ca/) (versions 8.x and above). 
- its [Wiki](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/wiki) contains the minutes for Islandora 8 Tech calls and User calls.
- it hosts the central [issue queue](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues) for the entire Islandora 8 project.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is written in [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) - the navigation structure is specified in `mkdocs.yml` and the `/docs/` folder contains the content. The text is written in mkdocs-flavoured markdown format and follows our [Documentation Style Guide](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/contributing/docs_style_guide/). Documentation is built and deployed to Github Pages automatically when new commits are added to the 'main' branch.
