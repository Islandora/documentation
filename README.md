## About this Repository

This "documentation" repository has three functions:

- it houses the source code for the [documentation](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/) of the [Islandora project](https://islandora.ca/) (versions 2.x and above). 
- its [Wiki](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/wiki) contains the minutes for archived Islandora Tech calls and User calls. Current meeting minutes can be found on the [community-wiki](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora-community/wiki).
- it hosts the central [issue queue](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues) for the entire Islandora project. Add an issue there if you have a use case that isn't addressed, or find a bug.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is written in [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) — the navigation structure is specified in `mkdocs.yml` and the `/docs/` folder contains the content. The text is written in mkdocs-flavoured markdown format and follows our [Documentation Style Guide](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/contributing/docs_style_guide/). Documentation is built and deployed to Github Pages automatically when new commits are added to the 'main' branch.
