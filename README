REQUIREMENTS

INSTALLATION
------------


CONFIGURATION
-------------

The islandora_drupal_filter passes the username of 'anonymous' through to 
Fedora for unauthenticated Drupal Users.  A user with the name of 'anonymous'
may have XACML policies applied to them that are meant to be applied to Drupal
users that are not logged in or vice-versa.  This is a potential security issue
that can be plugged by creating a user named 'anonymous' and restricting access
to the account.

Drupal's cron will can be ran to remove expired authentication tokens.
