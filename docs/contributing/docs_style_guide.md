# Documentation Style Guide

## Do's

- Submit documentation formatted in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format.
  -- Please add Markdown headings to the content sections.
- Use a GitHub Pull Request to submit documentation.
- Use the "bold/emphasis" style in Markdown for UI elements that users will interact with. For example, a button label for a button that must be pressed should be made bold in Markdown.
- Use the "italics" style in Markdown for UI elements that have a label or title if you need to reference them in the documentation. For example, a title of a screen or page that will visit should be made italic in Markdown.
- Use `-` instead of `*` for bulleted lists.
- Upload images to the 'assets' folder and reference them from there. 
   -- For file name, use underscores between words and prefix all file names with the page name, e.g. context_display_hints.jpg for the image showing how to set display hints in the context menu.
- Use `!!! note` at the start of a paragraph to have it rendered as a note like this:

!!! note "Helpful Tip" I am a helpful tip!

## Don'ts

- Do not leave any "trailing spaces" at the end of lines of content.
- Do not use "curly" quotes and apostrophes, use only "straight" quotes and apostrophes.
- Do not upload images that are excessively large in file size (remember, these docs are part of the software!)
