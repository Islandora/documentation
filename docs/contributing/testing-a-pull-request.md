# Testing a Pull Request (i.e. Running Custom Code)

If you are testing a pull request, or for other reasons need to replace the
"official" code with code that's in a PR, or a different branch or fork, this
page offers three methods: using Composer Patches, using Composer to
require the branch and/or fork, or installing source repositories with Composer.

This documentation applies to Drupal modules, themes, and recipes, or any
other project that is managed by Composer.

!!! note "Can't I just `git clone`?"
    When managing a non-developmental site with Composer, it's very fragile to
    use commands like `git clone` to obtain code, as it can be overwritten by
    a `composer update`.

    For those who are comfortable cloning code onto a development environment, refer to
    [Installing Git repositories with Composer](#installing-git-repositories-with-composer).

## Applying a Patch using Composer Patches

This method is best for testing pull requests, because it's very easy to get a
patch from a pull request. If the desired code is not the subject of a
PR, you can still use this method but must generate a `.patch` file yourself.
You may wish to use the [fork or branch](#using-composer-to-require-a-fork-or-branch)
method, as it is more dynamic.

Run the following commands from within your site's root folder. They will
update your `composer.json` file.

```shell
# Enable Composer Patches
composer config allow-plugins.cweagans/composer-patches true
composer require cweagans/composer-patches
```

For the next step, prepare the following replacement tokens:

* `MY_PACKAGE`: The full Composer name of the package to patch. It
  takes the form [vendor name]/[project name]. Example:
  `drupal/controlled_access_terms`
* `MY_ISSUE_TITLE`: A descriptive way to identify what the patch is for.
  Best practice is to include a link to the related issue -
  especially if you're going to keep this patch around for a while.
  Example: `Updated config format https://github.com/Islandora/controlled_access_terms/issues/117`
* `MY_PATCH_LOCATION`: Where to access the patch. See below.

To get the URL of a patch for a PR, go to the PR's main URL, and append
`.patch` to the URL. Make sure that your URL ends with `pull/XX.patch`
and not `pull/XX/files.patch` - the latter will not work.

If you don't have a PR, you could create a patch using `diff`. However, this
patch will be static and will need to be updated manually if your code
changes. You can put patches in a folder in your root directory such as `
[COMPOSER_ROOT]/assets/` and then the patch location would be
`assets/my_patch_name.patch`.

This one-liner, with the substitutions above, will add the patch to your
`composer.json`:

```shell
# Add patch to composer.json
composer config extra.patches --merge --json '{"MY_PACKAGE": {"MY_ISSUE_TITLE": "MY_PATCH_LOCATION"}}'

```

Or you could manually edit `composer.json` so it contains the following
(`...` denotes omitted content):
```json
{
  ...
  extra: {
    ...   
    patches: {
      "MY_PACKAGE": {
        "MY_ISSUE_TITLE": "MY_PATCH_LOCATION"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then, update your package (recall e.g. `drupal/controlled_access_terms`)
using Composer:

```shell
composer update MY_PACKAGE
```

The patch should apply, and then you will be running a patched version! If
you're using a dynamic patch, then running `composer update` again should
pull in changes to the code.

(OPTIONAL) If the patch includes configs ("/install/") that need to be imported, 
follow these steps:

1. **Update Ownership**: The patch may affect module file ownership, so
   ensure it is set correctly for the web server user:
   ```bash
   chown -R nginx: web/modules/contrib/MY_PACKAGE
   ```

2. **Export Configuration**: Export the current configuration before
   making any changes:
   ```bash
   drush config:export -y
   ```

3. **Copy Configuration**: If the patch includes configuration that needs to
   be imported, copy the relevant configuration file from the module to the
   `config/sync/` directory:
   ```bash
   cp web/modules/contrib/MY_PACKAGE/config/install/example.yml config/sync/
   ```

4. **Update Ownership of Configuration File**: Change the ownership of the copied
   configuration file to the web server user:
   ```bash
   chown -R nginx: config/sync/
   ```

5. **Import Configuration**: Import the configuration changes into the Drupal site:
   ```bash
   drush config:import -y
   ```

Make sure to export your existing configuration before copying over the new module
configuration. Composer updates the ownership of module files to root, so itâ€™s 
essential to switch it back to the `nginx` user for both the module files and the 
configuration files after copying.

## Using Composer to require a fork or branch

This method is best if you don't have a pull request open for the code.

### Step 1: Add a repository (if necessary)

If your code is on a fork, then you will need to add a repository to
Composer so that it knows where to get your package.

If the code that you want to test is a different branch/tag on the same
repository that you're currently getting your code from, then you do not
need to add a repository.

Prepare the following replacement tokens before adding a repository:

* `REPO_NAME`: a name for this repository (mandatory if using the composer
  one-liner), e.g. `rosiel-islandora`
* `REPO_URL`: the URL to the repository, e.g. `https://github.com/rosiel/islandora`

```shell
# Add custom repo
composer config repo.REPO_NAME vcs REPO_URL
```
Your `composer.json` file should now contain

```json
{
  ...
  "repositories": {
    ...
    "REPO_NAME": {
      "type": "vcs",
      "url": "REPO_URL"
    }
  }
}
```

!!! note "Order of precedence of repositories"
    If you have a matching version spec (e.g. branch name) that's available
    from multiple repositories, e.g. both islandora's Gitlab and your personal
    fork both have an `enable-hocr` branch, then the repository that's first
    in the list in composer.json will take precedence.

### Step 2: Require the custom branch

This step could be as simple as
```shell
composer require MY_PACKAGE:dev-MY_BRANCH_NAME
```

with the following replacements:

* `MY_PACKAGE`: the full Composer name of the package. Example:
`drupal/islandora`
* `MY_BRANCH_NAME`: the name of the branch you want to run. Example:
  `testing-fedora-6`. Note that in the case that your branch name is
  "version-like" for example `2.x`, then the `dev` goes at the end, as in
  `2.x-dev`, instead of preceding the branch name as in the template above.


However, if your component is a dependency of another component, then you
will probably need to use an alias. This allows your custom code to "act as"
a version that will meet the requirements of your other component. For
example, if the `drupal/islandora_mirador` package requires
`drupal/islandora:^2.4.1`, then using Composer to require the `enable-hocr`
branch of `drupal/islandora` will not meet the requirements. Instead, use
`as` to provide an alias, to a version that will match the constraints. Note
the quotes around the package name and version spec. This takes the form:

```shell
composer require "MY_PACKAGE:dev-MY_BRANCH_NAME as ALIAS"
```
For example:
```shell
composer require "drupal/islandora:dev-enable-hocr as 2.12.1"
```

That will install the specified branch and allow it to work with your
dependencies.

## Installing Git repositories with Composer

This method pulls the source (i.e. Git) repositories directly into your project
and will allow you to pull in open pull requests by simply following a normal
Git workflow.

!!!note
    If the site has already been installed without using `--prefer-source` you
    will need to clear Composer's cache via `composer clearcache` or including
    `--no-cache` for any `install` or `reinstall` commands (as below).

### Step 1: Re-install the code from source (if required)
Assuming that the environment has not been installed with `--prefer-source`,
reinstall the package.

```shell
composer reinstall MY_PACKAGE --prefer-source
```
with the following replacements:

* `MY_PACKAGE`: the full Composer name of the package. Example:
  `drupal/islandora`

This will pull the code from the source repository (i.e. including the `.git`
files) and add the package code at the same version of the `MY_PACKAGE`
that was previously installed and is in the lock file.

For example:
```shell
composer reinstall "drupal/islandora" --prefer-source --no-cache
```

### Step 2: Pull the code from the pull request to review.
Follow Github's [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/checking-out-pull-requests-locally)
to pull the code from the pull request to review.

Now you can test your specified code, as well as edit the code and create
commits. Note that if you're doing this in a throwaway environment such as a VM
or a Docker Container, you will need to configure authentication (e.g.
install an SSH key with Github) before you can push your commits.

## To reset these changes

### ... using Composer Patches

When you no longer need to be applying the patch, simply remove it from the
`patches:` section of `composer.json` (and of course, take care to ensure the
json remains valid, by adjusting commas!) and run `composer update MY_PACKAGE`.

### ... using Composer require

When you no longer want to pull from a separate branch or fork, reset the
version constraint back to what it used to be, or, if your package was not
originally in `composer.json` (because it is required as a dependency by
another package), you can delete the requirement from your `composer.json`.
Then run `composer update MY_PACKAGE`. If you added a repository, it's
safest to delete the repository, as it could lead to you getting stale
branches from a fork rather than the desired active code from the canonical
repository.

### ... using source repositories

When you no longer want the custom code present simply reset the branch back to
the default branch or tag.
