# Adding an object to a collection in Islandora 7.x-2.x

## `Adding` instead of `Ingesting`

I am going to start using Drupal terminology where it makes sense. Once you've got a collection node created, you can associate some content with it.  This will be important when we want to create collection views.

## Adding a `Basic Image` content type to an existing collection.

The `Basic Image` content type provides the user with the option to upload a gif, jpg, or png image to Fedora along with descriptive metadata. Similar to other Drupal content types there are only a few steps to add a `Basic Image`.

 1.  Select `Add content` from the admin menu or the Navigation block, then select  Basic Image from the list of content types.

 2. Fill in the fields in the associated metadata form. Ensure you include:
   1. the title of your image
   2. choose the image file to upload
   3. select the parent collection you want your image to be a member of.

 3. Select `Save` to create a new `Basic Image`.

 4. Your new `Basic Image` displayed in Drupal.
