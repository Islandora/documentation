# Accessing Islandora with Amazon Alexa

The following recipe details how to connect Islandora with Alexa, using custom Alexa skills and the Drupal Alexa module. The potential applications are broad:

- Send Citations, metadata, whatever we want to the user if they have set up their email
- Creating a collaborative exhibit
- Play audio and video objects and read transcripts
- Respond to user search queries (like how many objects match the subject in the repositories)
- Answer specific questions about the object (“_Invocation Name_, when was this recorded?”)
- Interact with other applications or modules (got a print ordering system? Want to add event calendar items to your exhibit?)
- Be accessed via web page, Alexa device, or phone app
