## Downloading and Enabling Drupal Modules and Themes

Islandora 8 can make use of majority of Drupal 8 [modules](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module) and [themes](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme). Common use cases have been documented in the [Islandora 8 Cookbook](https://github.com/manez/Islandora-Cookbook). There are several ways to download and install Drupal modules. Please refer to [this guide](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/extending-drupal-8) on Drupal.org.

[Composer](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-install-drupal-and-manage-dependencies) is the recommended method to install and update drupal modules and themes in Islandora 8. In the [Islandora 8 playbook](https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/claw-playbook), you can add the drupal module's or theme's machine name to the `drupal_composer_dependencies` variable [here](https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/claw-playbook/blob/master/inventory/vagrant/group_vars/webserver/drupal.yml). To enable the drupal module, add the module machine name to the `drupal_enable_modules` variable as well. For modules that require additional steps, additional tasks may need to be added to the ansible playbook. Re provisioning your instance via ansible will install the module.
