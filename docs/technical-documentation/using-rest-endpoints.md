# Islandora via REST

Each node, media and file in Drupal has its own URI and we can GET the resources, some in a variety of formats.

We can also create nodes, media and files in Drupal by using PUT and/or POST requests.

We can update the field content by using a PATCH request and lastly we can DELETE a node, media or file resource.

To perform these actions, you will need the `RESTful Web Services` module enabled.

To configure your setup via the UI, you also need the `RESTful UI` module enabled.

Then you can configure your REST services at `https://<yourmachine>/admin/config/services/rest`

This screenshot shows the setup for resources, you can see the various HTTP methods and what formats they will respond in and what authentication methods they support.
